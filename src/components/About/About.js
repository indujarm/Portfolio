<p>
  Hello! I'm a passionate and self-driven B.E. student in Computer Science and Design, with a strong interest in building practical and user-friendly software solutions. I enjoy backend and full-stack development, and I love exploring how code can be used to solve real-world problems in simple ways.
</p>
<p>
  I learn best through hands-on workâ€”building projects, exploring new tools, and improving my problem-solving through regular coding practice. I believe in writing clean code, staying curious, and constantly improving with each experience. My goal is to grow as a developer who builds with purpose and clarity.
